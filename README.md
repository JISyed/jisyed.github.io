Personal Website. I show my works here, mostly coding and game development. Will use this as my blog for the unforseeable future.

Powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

The content of this blog is (C) Jibran Syed, unless otherwise specified (art from other people, team projects, etc).

Template based off the [HPSTR Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) from [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/work/), but greatly modified by me.
