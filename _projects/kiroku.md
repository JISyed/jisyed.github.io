**Kiroku** is the codename of the code running my personal blog (this website). The word "kiroku" is Japanese for "record" (as in keeping a record of the things I work on).

Kiroku is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is heavily based off the theme [HPSTR](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/), by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/). However, I modified my fork of the HPSTR code to accomodate listing projects that I work on, and to accomodate categorizing my projects and posts into 6 "domains": Art, Audio, Code, Game-Dev, Linguisitcs, and Writing.
