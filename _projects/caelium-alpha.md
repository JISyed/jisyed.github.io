## About

**Caelium Alpha** is a digital orrery sandbox. 

An [orrery](https://www.google.com/search?q=orrery&tbm=isch) is a model of the solar system; small worlds you can carry with you. Make your own little planetary system orrery by adding planets, moons, and adjusting properties. Then marvel at the possibilities in the universe :)

There are 2 editions of Caelium Alpha: *LD38 Edition* and *Post-LD Edition*. *LD38 Edition* was made in 72 hours for the 38th Ludum Dare game jam. That edition has strange bugs and little features. It is highly recommended to play the *Post-LD Edition*, which has the bugs fixed, and more features. Both editions are avaliable for download on itch.io (link below).

## Features

 - Start off with a star and adjust its properties (radius, color, etc.)
 - Add planets to the star, and adjust their properties
 - Add moons to each planet, and adjust their properties
 - Automatic padding between every astronomical body, fully adjustable
 - Properties include color, radius, padding, axial speed (rotation), and orbital speed (revolution)
 - Guarantee that most stars spawned will have a unique name
 - Planet and moon names are based off stars (just like real exoplanets)
 - Stars, planets, and moons will spawn with random surface texture (not adjustable at this time)
