## About

XboxCtrlrInput is a C# wrapper for Unity3D that handles Xbox 360 controller input. It’s used in the same way as Unity’s Input class. It’s not a script and thus does not need to be attached to any GameObject. You can read my reasons for starting this project [here](https://jibransyed.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/the-motivation-behind-xboxctrlrinput/). See the latest issues [here](https://github.com/JISyed/Unity-XboxCtrlrInput/issues?state=open). The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/JISyed/Unity-XboxCtrlrInput/wiki/Coding-Reference).

The goals of XboxCtrlrInput are:

 1. To be able to make simple calls to Xbox controller input that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
 2. And to be able to handle multiple Xbox controllers that works as you expect.

The project is hosted on Github and I invite anyone to help contribute. It’s free, open source, and public domain. Be sure to read the README file on Github.
