Since moving to Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I wanted a way to write a new blog post from a mobile device. I admit that I might not write from a mobile device often, but it's nice to have, and Wordpress.com has an app to make this task easier. 

I looked for ways to write posts on an iOS device and somehow post it on this blog. Long story short, I [found a way from hardscrabble](http://www.hardscrabble.net/2015/how-to-jekyll-from-ios) that involves using an app called [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/). It's a pretty advanced text writing app with tons of features like templates, and custom workflows. Instruction provided by hardscrabble provide instructions on setting up the app to write to your Jekyll-powered blog (if it's hosted on GitHub Pages). 

This whole post was written in and sent from the Editorial app.
