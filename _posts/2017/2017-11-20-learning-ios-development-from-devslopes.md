Lately, I was learning mobile app development on iOS platforms. Since I always use an iPhone (and sometimes an iPad), I figured that I should be able to write software for these things.

I was actually exposed to iOS development before, in the distant past. Back then, it was very difficult and confusing, but I must admit that my programming skills were not as sharp back then either.

But now I finished learning the basics of iOS development from the [DevSlopes team](https://devslopes.com/){:target="_blank"} on Udemy. If you like being self-directed in your learning but want some guidance, DevSlopes is great for that.

Last month, I completed [their iOS 11 & Swift 4 course](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/){:target="_blank"}. You can see [my **Certificate of Completion** here](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-68TLAGBR/){:target="_blank"}.

At DevSlopes, you code several projects, learning the different aspects of the iOS platform. The following is a select list of such projects I uploaded onto GitHub. You can see screenshots and more information there:

 - [**RetroCalc**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-RetroCalc){:target="_blank"}**:** A simple iOS calculator app
 - [**Ramp Up**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-RampUp){:target="_blank"}**:** An iOS ARKit demo featuring live-sized skateboard ramps
 - [**Rainy Shine**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-RainyShine){:target="_blank"}**:** A very simple weather app for iOS with 5-day forecast
 - [**Goal Post**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-GoalPost){:target="_blank"}**:** An iOS app demo utilizing Core Data to try to track new goals
 - [**Bot Vision**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-BotVision){:target="_blank"}**:** An iOS machine learning demo (using CoreML) where the app tries to recognize everyday objects
 - [**Pixel City**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-PixelCity){:target="_blank"}**:** An iOS app demo were users can browse Flickr photos based off map locations
 - [**Breakpoint**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-Breakpoint){:target="_blank"}**:** A micro social networking iOS app demo aimed for coders and other geeks, powered by Firebase
 - [**Confaby**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-Confaby){:target="_blank"}**:** An iOS Slack clone demo app that features realtime chat messaging
 - [**Scribe**](https://github.com/JISyed/DevSlopesProj-Scribe){:target="_blank"}**:** An iOS app demo that dictates a pre-recorded voice message
