I am happy to announce that the Post-LD Edition of Caelium Alpha is [now avaliable on Itch.io](https://jishenaz.itch.io/caelium-alpha). [Last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017/2017-04-27-made-an-orrery-sandbox-for-a-game-jam.md %}), I mentioned about a bug where planets would clone multiple times. Fortunately, that bug was fixed, and I also added the ability to add moons, which wasn't supported in the original Ludum Dare entry.

The Post-LD Edition also features a soundtrack from the composer [Stephen Tanksley](https://soundcloud.com/stephen-tanksley) (great music for modern games) and sound effects from [Glitchmachines](http://glitchmachines.com/shop/). Audio really does make a big difference!

If you are interested in reading more about the original Ludum Dare version of Caelium Alpha, you can read about it on [its Ludum Dare page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/caelium-alpha/).
