I recently participated in the 33<sup>rd</sup> [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/) online game jam.

My entry was called [Galactic Space Crusher](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=26581). You play as a giant spaceship who must wipe out fleets of enemies with an arsenal of weapons.

I couldn't develop it enough the way I wanted, but if I decide to develop this, I'll try to make it much better.
