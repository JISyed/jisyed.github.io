In interactive media (ie. video games), procedural generation is gaining momentum, and I think it's a really cool concept; making computers do the art (or level design).

Another thing I think is cool is outer space, especially planets. The best of both worlds collided back in the early 2010's with an old iPad app called [Planetary](http://planetary.bloom.io/). It made very good use of procedural generation techniques to make life-like planets on the screen. Unfortunately that app doesn't exist anymore (although [the source code is available](https://github.com/cooperhewitt/Planetary)).

That app inspired me to try to make procedurally generated planets. I found an opportunity to do so as a grad school research project. The result is the library Procedutex, which can procedurally generate textures of many kinds, although I mostly used it to demonstrate planetary textures.

You can read more about it at the [project's page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects-old/procedutex/index.md %}), or you can [get the source directly from GitHub](https://github.com/JISyed/Procedutex) (code is Windows only).
