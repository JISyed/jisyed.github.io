I made a game a while ago for [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) called Gyra. It's my most polished Ludum Dare game yet. You can play it [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=26581).

You can see what other Ludum Dare games I made [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jishenaz/).
