Long ago I made a game jam entry for Ludum Dare called The Other Sky, and while it wasn't well developed, I still liked the outcome. I made soundspaces for that game by messing around with a tonematrix in [AudioTool](https://www.audiotool.com/), then I stretched the sound very long with [PaulStretch](http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/), resulting in something that sounds like a soundspace.
