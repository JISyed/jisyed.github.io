During college, I took an Android Development course, and the result of my final project was a neat app called Chott (an acronym for "Creative Hobby Occurrence Time Tracker"). The premise behind the app was to track the time spend on creative hobbies/work, a concept partially inspired by [Devine Lu Linvega's Horaire](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Horaire).

I actually use iPhone most of the time, so I don't use Chott. I'll consider making something similar in iOS later. Regardless, it's a usable app (although you cannot delete records made in the app). If you have an Android device and Android Studio, you can [go straight to GitHub](https://github.com/JISyed/CHOTT-Android-App) to get the source, or go to [Chott's page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects/chott/index.md %}) for more info on the project.
