Well this is it. This is the end of this blog. It will remain here on this URL for the time being, but eventually I will move out to Codeberg, and probably use a different blogging engine.

I'm trying to remove Github stuff from my life for let's say "ethical reasons". Won't speak more on the matter, it should be easy to look up.

I will eventually move to a new blog, which will hopefully be simpler and easier to maintain. I probably won't be using Jekyll because that's also made by Github. This blog wasn't maintained for a while, but hopefully the new one will be. I'll most likely post it here when it's ready. Later!
