I'm glad to announce that Chott is now available on the App Store!

In case you didn't know, Chott is a time tracking app aiming specifically for tracking personal creative projects. I made a [prototypical version of this for Android]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects-old/chott/index.md %}) before, but this version has more features, like deleting projects and sessions.

For more information about Chott for iOS, you can check out [its project page here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects-old/chott-for-ios/index.md %}). Or you can click the black button below to get the app. It's free!
