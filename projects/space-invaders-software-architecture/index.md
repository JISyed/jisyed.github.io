## About

At DePaul University, there is a grad-level class where you learn software architecture by remaking the famous game Space Invaders, with design patterns! It was among the harder courses in the game programming curriculum.

This game was made using a pre-compiled game engine called Azul, which was made by [Ed Keenan](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/about/pages/people/facultyinfo.aspx?fid=562). The engine exposed only a little API into C#, so I had to develop sophistcated software systems in little time.

Fonts, sprites, and sounds are not made by me.

Loading the code project will require at least Visual Studios 2012 or later. Only made for Windows.
