Jibran I. Syed (a.k.a. Jishenaz) is a coder who specialized in game development.

He works with gameplay code, game engine technology, sometimes mobile development, and on rare occasions: art. More than art, he loves the emerging interections between art and technology.

From time to time, Jibran will share his projects here, along with ideas, and something random once in a while.

Expect more developments soon. Check out [the blog]({{ site.url }}), or if you want to talk, email at [{{ site.owner.email }}](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}), or follow [@{{ site.owner.twitter }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.owner.twitter }}) on Twitter.

Resum√© coming soon...
